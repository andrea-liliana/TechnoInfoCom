# Information and coding theory

The code correspond to the implementation of different information measures, such as the entropy, joint entropy, mutual information, etc. That are used in the context of a medical diagnosis and to play the minesweeper puzzle game with an information theory-based strategy.

This repository contains as well the implementation of compression algorithms such as Huffman, Lempel-Ziv and LZ77 for the storage of genomic data. Also applied to encode and decode a noisy channel.
